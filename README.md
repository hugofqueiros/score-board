# score-board

Simple lib that implements a scoreboard of ongoing matches and their scores

Please install the one dependency we have in the project before testing it:

`npm i`

## Test

`npm test`

## Considerations

- choose the Object Oriented classes in javacript as requested. We could have done in functional programing. The way it was implemented allows for better organization, readability. Inheritance can be incorporated if the solution needs to be extended.
- Matches are stored in an array as a storage solution. as per requirements
- Tried to cover as much edge cases as I could think of.
